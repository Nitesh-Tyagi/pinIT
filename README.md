# pinIT
pinIT is a django based text only forum which provides complete anonymity to it's users. pinIT does not ask for any personal information from it's users providing a safe platform to channel out your views and opinions.

Recreating this project would require some experience in Django and python, along with basic knowledge of database management and frontend development.

Migrations and Database have already been created.

- src/trydjango is the project.
- src/posts is the app.
- src/templates contains the HTML and CSS templates.
- src/posts/static contains some static files(images, etc.) used in the templates.

Feel free to use the code or contact me for any queries. Constructive criticism is always welcome!
